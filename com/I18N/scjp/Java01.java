        Internationalization.

        The process of designing web application in such a way that which provide support for various countries and various languages, various currencies without performing any change in the application, is called Internationalization(I18N).

        For example, If the request is coming from india then the response should be india people understandable form.

        And if the request is coming from USA then the response should be in USA people understandable form.

        We can implement Internationalization by using the following three classes.

        Locale,
        NumberFormat
        DateFormat
        


        
        */
    }
    
}
