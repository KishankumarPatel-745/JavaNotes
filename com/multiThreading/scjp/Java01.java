        1, Introduction 

        Multitasking.
        Executing several tasks simantaneously is a concept of multitasking.

        There ara two types of multitasking.
        1, Process-based multitasking.
        2, Thread-based multitasking

        Process-based multitasking.

        Executing several tasks simantaneously where each task is a separate indepandent programm(Process) is called process-based multitasking.

        eg.
        While typing a JAVA programm in the editor. we can listen audio song from same system. At the same time, we can download a file from net.

        All this tasks will be executed simantaneously and independent of each other. Hence it is process-based multitasking.

        Process-based multitasking is best suitable at OS level.

        Thread-based multitasking.

        Executing several task simantaneously where each task is a seperate independent part of the same programm is called Thread-Based Multitasking.
        Each independent part is called a Thread.

        Thread-based multitasking is best suitable at programatic level.

        Whether it is process-based or thread-based,The main objective of multitasking is to reduce response time of the system.
        And to improve performance.

        The main important application area of multithreading are to develop multimedia graphics,To develop animation, to develop video game.To develop Web servers and Application server,Etc.

        When compared with old languages, Developing multithreading application in java is very easy because Java provides in-build support for multithreading with rich API.
