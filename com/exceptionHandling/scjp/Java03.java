        Checked and Unchecked exception.
        *****Checked Exception VS Unchecked Exception

        The exception which is checked by compiler for smooth execution of the programm are called checked exception.
        eg.
        HallTicketMissingException
        PenNotWorkingException
        FileNotFoundException.

        In our programm,if there is a chance of rising checked exception then compulsory we should handle that checked exception either by try-check or by throws keyword otherwise we will get CTE.


        The exception which are not checked by compiler whether programmer handling or not.
        Such type of exceptions are called Unchecked exception.
        Eg
        Arithmatic Exception.
        BombBlastException 
        Etc.

        NOTE:
        whether it is checked or unchecked every exception occurs at runtime only.There is no chance of occuring any exception at compile time.

        Note02.
        RuntimeException and its child classes, Error and its child classes are unchecked.
        Except this remaining are checked exception.
        
        Fully Checked VS Parcially checked.

        A checked exception is said to be fully checked if all its child classes also checked.
        eg.
        IOException, InterruptedException


        A checked exception is said to be partially checked if some of its child classes are unchecked.
        eg.
        Exception,Throwable..etc

        Note:-
        the only possible partially checked exception in java are Exception and Throwable.
