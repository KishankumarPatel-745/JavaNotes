        Command Line Argument: argument passing from the command prompt.


        The argument,which are passing from command prompt are called Command Line Argument. with this command line argument JVM will create an array and passing that array JVM will call the main() method.

        java test A B C
        args[0]=A
        args[1]=B
        args[2]=C


        The main Objective of command line argument is we can customize the behaviour of the main method.

        Case01:
        class Test{
            public static void main(String[] args){

            }
        }

        Within main() method, Command Line Argument is availble in String form.
        
        usually space itself is a separator between arguments.
        but if the argument itself contains space then we have to enclose the command line argument in double quotes.
