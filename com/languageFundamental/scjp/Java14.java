        1.7Version Enhancement with Respect to main() method

        until 1.6v,If the class doesnot contain main method then we will get runtime exception saying NoSuchMethodError:main

        But from 1.7version onword,we will get more elobarated error infomation.
        error:Main method not found in class Test, Please define Main method as 
        public static void main(String[] args)

        from 1.7v onward, main method is mendatory to start programm execution.even though class contain static block it wont be executed fi class doesnot contain main() method.

        without writing main() method is it possible to print some statement to the console?

        Yes by using static block till 1.6V.
        But after 1.7V, it is not possible.
